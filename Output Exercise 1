Hello! My name is Aisyah and currently studying in IT courses.
I started my day with my morning routine which I take a bath and breakfirst.
I have a time before the class started. So, I use this time to do own exercise on coding.
After 30 minutes studying and doing coding exercise,
the class have started and I have to focus what the lecturer is explaining about the subject. Awesome!
After finished the class, take a break for lunch and take a nap before Zuhur.
Wake up and continuing for next class till evening.
Class finished! I want to do my own activity.
Hang out with my friends and have a dinner.
At night, do some homework, continue doing the coding exercise for about two hours.
